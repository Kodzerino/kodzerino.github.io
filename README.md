# I am a liar

This message is for everyone who I consider to be very close to me. I have bonded with you either over Discord or in the MMOs I play(WoW, Endless Online, Warframe, Lost Ark etc)
I am about to tell you something that you might find deeply disturbing, repulsive or just plainly distasteful.

**I am a pathological liar.**

# The extent of my lies

Whenever I have spoken to you about anything related to my personal life, there is a very high chance that it was either a complete or partial lie.
The most common thing I lie about is my age and my so called "work" or "job". I am not a storyteller or attention seeker, my lies are always based on some form of truth. I try to keep the lies at a minimum since it is too difficult for me to make them up or keep them consistent.

# The beginning
Back in 2011, I played my first MMO. It was called Endless Online, a game that launched in 2002, the same year that I was born. When I started playing it, the game was already dead and the glory days were over. Majority of the players who still stuck around were just there for the nostalgia. Back then, I used to be very honest since my mother was my role model and she was the most honest person I knew. I was so honest, that when the game wanted me to pick a name for my character I just wrote my real name.
That game was where I was able to talk to someone from another country for the first time. It was an amazing experience and I loved every moment of it. Interacting with people through the internet was such a cool experience for me that I went around talking with everybody and striking up a conversation. However, it wasn't long until people in the community started to know about me. A 9 year old boy playing Endless Online, people would make fun of me or try to scam me. I still remember the first time I got scammed so vividly, it made me cry since I had lost my Scav Bow + 50k gold over a simple trade window swap scam. It felt like an absolute tragedy since I was such a naive and innocent little kid.
My overall experience with people in that game's community wasn't that great and I couldn't really play other MMOs as my PC's specs were really terrible at the time. Eventually I got catfished by a "girl" and literally lost my entire account. (Yes, thats how dumb I was)
Having already become a MMO addict(or I guess, more specifically an Endless Online addict), I couldn't just quit the game there. I decided to start over with a new name. Looking back, that was the turning point and the beginning of my lies. I created a character called "Kingofdemonz", the use of "z" in "demonz" instead of "s" was a deliberate choice as I was a big fan of Dragon Ball Z and the letter Z seemed so cool.. But I digress.
Along with my new name, I decided to create a new persona. I also decided that I would introduce myself as a veteran player who used to play back in the glory days. The sole reason for this was that while I was playing on my previous character, I noticed after having conversations with many people in the community that those who claimed to be playing when the game was popular didn't have any trouble making friends because everyone playing the game would accept people like that thinking "oh this guy is one of us!"
