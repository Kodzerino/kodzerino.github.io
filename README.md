# I AM A LIAR

This message is for everyone who I consider to be very close to me. I have bonded with you either over Discord or in the MMOs I play(WoW, Endless Online, Warframe, Lost Ark etc)
I am about to tell you something that you might find deeply disturbing, repulsive or just plainly distasteful.

**I am a pathological liar.**

# THE EXTENT OF MY LIES

Whenever I have spoken to you about anything related to my personal life, there is a very high chance that it was either a complete or partial lie.
The most common thing I lie about is my age and my so called "work" or "job". I am not a storyteller or attention seeker, my lies are always based on some form of truth. I try to keep the lies at a minimum since it is too difficult for me to make them up or keep them consistent.

**Also, I want to make one thing very clear.. I have only ever lied about things related to my personal life. I have never lied about other people.**

# THE BEGINNING
Back in 2011, I played my first MMO. It was called Endless Online, a game that launched in 2002, the same year that I was born. When I started playing it, the game was already dead and the glory days were over. Majority of the players who still stuck around were just there for the nostalgia. Back then, I used to be very honest since my mother was my role model and she was the most honest person I knew. I was so honest, that when the game wanted me to pick a name for my character I just wrote my real name.
That game was where I was able to talk to someone from another country for the first time. It was an amazing experience and I loved every moment of it. Interacting with people through the internet was such a cool experience for me that I went around talking with everybody and striking up a conversation. However, it wasn't long until people in the community started to know about me. A 9 year old boy playing Endless Online, people would make fun of me or try to scam me. I still remember the first time I got scammed so vividly, it made me cry since I had lost my Scav Bow + 50k gold over a simple trade window swap scam. It felt like an absolute tragedy as it was my first time experiencing betrayal since I was such a naive and innocent little kid.
My overall experience with people in that game's community wasn't that great and I couldn't really play other MMOs as my PC's specs were really terrible at the time. Eventually after a year, I got catfished by a "girl" and literally lost my entire account. (Yes, that's how dumb I was)
Having already become a MMO addict(or I guess, more specifically an Endless Online addict), I couldn't just quit the game there. I decided to start over with a new name. Looking back, that was the turning point and the beginning of my lies. I created a character called "Kingofdemonz", the use of "z" in "demonz" instead of "s" was a deliberate choice as I was a big fan of Dragon Ball Z and the letter Z seemed so cool.. But I digress.
Along with my new name, I also decided that I would introduce myself as a veteran player who used to play back in the glory days. The sole reason for this was that while I was playing on my previous character, I noticed after having conversations with many people in the community that those who claimed to be playing when the game was popular didn't have any trouble making friends because everyone in the community would accept people like that thinking "oh this guy is one of us!"
Right after that I thought "Oh but wait.. one more thing! There's no way anyone would believe me if I was a veteran player if I'm 10 years old.. I have to lie about my age as well... I guess everyone playing this game is around 10 years older than me on average, so I will just add 10 and say that I am 20 years old!"

**This was where it all began.**

# I CARRIED THE LIES WITH ME EVERYWHERE

Around 2017, after my best friend had passed away, I finally quit playing Endless Online and branched out to other MMOs. At this point I had finally got a good enough PC to play games that I missed out on due to how bad my old PC was. I discovered World of Warcraft private servers through a recommendation of a friend from Endless Online. I made a character on Elysium, it was an amazing experience and I enjoyed it a lot as it was my first time playing a 3D MMO(up until this point, I had only played 2D or isometric-based games because of the bad specs on my old PC)
I had quickly picked up on the fact that the people who played on these private servers are of the same kind as those I met on Endless Online. They are both here for the nostalgia and miss the glory days. So, I decided to keep going with my persona that is 10 years older than me. I told the same kind of lies as I did in Endless Online, to make it sound like I played back in those "glory days" so that people would not think of me as different and I could fit in.

**But by this point, I started to notice every time I lied, there was always a feeling of guilt, regret or that something was wrong.**

# LIES AFTER LIES AFTER LIES AFTER LIES

After starting with lying about something as simple as my age, I began to add lies on top of them to make myself sound more convincing. I always retionalized it by thinking "These people are strangers to me, there's no way they'd ever know and there's no harm in telling lies about myself as it doesn't affect them."
Since I lied about being 10 years older, I would think about my life 10 years from now and where I want to be or where I could be, and then base my lies around those fantasies of my own future. 

**Around when I was 17 years old, I started to grow tired from all of it. I started to realize how wrong my actions truly were. The feeling of guilt and regret started to grow much more rapidly.**

# CONFLICT

While I was doing all of these things online, I also had a personal life. I made a lot of friends in high school and college, and I also still keep in touch with some of them. But one thing I regret the most was that my dishonestly online had led me to hide things from people in real life. Even though none of my classmates were into playing MMOs to begin with, I still felt sad that I couldn't really share about the kinds of games I played because it might eventually lead me to telling them that I go around lying to everyone online about my age and my personal life.
This created a feeling of being distant but I still somehow managed to get through everything since I could still talk about my favorite TV shows or anime with them.

**But, I was beginning to finally reach my limit, the lies I tell online are finally bringing its consequences.**

# CONTEMPLATION

Over the course of many years, I've made a lot of good friends and had great experiences. I laughed, I cried, I learned and I truly lived. Everyone who is probably reading this is someone I truly admire and respect. And... It's because of that feeling, that I felt afraid. I felt afraid that if I told the truth now, it would be the end of our friendship and I would lose everything. Everyone would lose all respect for me and everything will be over.

**The fear of loss was too overbearing, but I knew that I would have to face it one day because this cannot go on forever.**

# WHO AM I?

My real name is Farhan Kamal. (I'm not afraid of getting doxxed as this is a very common name in Bangladesh)
My real age is 21. I was born on January 21st, 2002.
I am unemployed and I am currently studying in a university to get my degree in Business Management.
I am currently living with my grandparents who I am taking care of since they would be living alone after my Uncle left Bangladesh to go settle down and have a family in Sweden.
Everything else I disclosed about my personal life to you that is not related to the above information is either completely or partially true. Feel free to ask me if you feel curious, I will be 100% honest from this point forward.

**I am deeply sorry to anyone who felt like they could relate to me in some way since you thought I might be similar to you because of lies that I told you about myself.**

# CONCLUSION

I am not writing this because I seek forgiveness. I do not want you to feel pity or justify in some way that my actions are not wrong. **There is nothing that could possibly excuse a liar.** I would be completely fine if you decided to hate me or stop talking to me. I have now planted a seed of doubt in your mind and you will always be wary of me, I have publicly revealed the fact that I am deceptive and manipulative. 

**I wrote this because I was finally ready to face the consequences.**
